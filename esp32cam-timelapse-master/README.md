# esp32cam-timelapse
Create time-lapse images using the ESP32-CAM and other ESP32 based camera modules

There are three sketches:

**timelapse-javascript.ino** display captured photos in the browser and use JavaScript to save them.

**timelapse-sd.ino** capture and write photos to a microSD card reader.

**timelapse-server.ino** capture and send photos to a server on the internet.
